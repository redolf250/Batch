They also think that contributing to open-source is all about coding.&#10;&#10;But that is not true! You can contribute to this projects in other ways, such as:&#10;&#10;-Writing documentation&#10;-Creating supporting materials&#10;-Reviewing code&#10;-Translating to other languages&#10;-Structure and re-structure the code and project structure&#10;&#10;&#10;About Open Source Software and the benefits of contributing&#10;Before going further, let's clarify what open source means and what are the benefits of contributing to open source as a developer.&#10;&#10;In the simplest terms, open-source software is software whose source code is available to anyone. As a result, people can see the implementation of the software and even contribute themselves to it. An example is the code editor Visual Studio Code, whose repository you can see here.&#10;&#10;On the other hand, Github is an example of closed-source software. That means only specific people have access to the source code. Usually, the specific people are the founding organization/people and the team.&#10;&#10;Now that you know what open source is, let's see the benefits of contributing to open-source software. The most notable benefits are as follows:&#10;&#10;Contributing to popular software can bring great satisfaction knowing that lots of people use your code.&#10;You accelerate the progress of your programming skills. Writing code for a real-world application used by people is very different to building side projects.&#10;&#10;-By contributing to open source, you learn how to work in a team and a collaborative environment.&#10;-It can bring job opportunities; companies might notice your contributions and offer you a job.&#10;-By contributing, you can learn new skills. For instance, if you learnt a new programming language, you can    contribute to a project using that language.&#10;-You develop non-technical skills such as communication, writing, problem-solving, creativity skills.&#10;-Therefore, you can see that contributing to open-source software can bring lots of valuable benefits. It is a great way to accelerate your developer career.&#10;&#10;" wrapText="true" />
